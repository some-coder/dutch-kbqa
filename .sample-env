# EXAMPLE DOTENV FILE
#
# Make a copy of this file with the name `.env`. This `.env` is often called a
# 'dotenv file'. It serves as a configuration file for running programs in
# this repository.
#   The guides in the `documentation/` subdirectory will sometimes require you
# to change values in this file. Do so to generate the right outputs.
#   Unless marked with '(Optional.)', the environment variables below are
# required.


# `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` stores the file system location of your
# Google Cloud service account credentials, which Google Cloud hands to you in
# the form of a JSON file.
#   Refer to `documentation/google-cloud.md` for details.
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="${PWD}/.service-account-key.json"


# `$SPLIT` stores the LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset split that you want programs to work
# on. The only two legal values for it are: "train" and "test".
SPLIT="train"


# `$SOURCE_LANGUAGE` stores the ISO 639-1 code of the natural language in which
# LC-QuAD 2.0 is expressed.
#   Since LC-QuAD 2.0 is published in English, leave it set to "en".
SOURCE_LANGUAGE="en"


# `$TARGET_LANGUAGE` stores the ISO 639-1 code of the natural language in which
# the derived dataset is expressed.
#   The paper associated to this repostory uses Dutch, so the default is "nl".
#   Note that, if you want to use any other natural language than Dutch, you
# need to make some code changes. Specifically, multiple `enum`s probably need
# an additional entry for your extra language.
TARGET_LANGUAGE="nl"


# `$TRANSLATE_SAVE_FREQ` stores the frequency of saving to disk during
# translation of the LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset from `$SOURCE_LANGUAGE` to
# `$TARGET_LANGUAGE`, expressed as the number of entries to process between
# two successive saves-to-disk.
TRANSLATE_SAVE_FREQ=50


# `$LABEL_LANGUAGE` stores the ISO 639-1 code of the natural language in which
# to collect labels for WikiData entities and properties.
#   It has two legal values: `$SOURCE_LANGUAGE` and `TARGET_LANGUAGE`. See
# above.
LABEL_LANGUAGE="$SOURCE_LANGUAGE"


# (Optional.) `$REFERENCE_TRANSLATED_FILE` stores the file system location of a
# 'reference translation' of the LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset in `$TARGET_LANGUAGE`.
#   If supplied, you can run the program
# `shell-scripts/validation/valide-translation.sh` to see how much your
# translation deviates from the reference. It is largely meant for debugging,
# and is not used at any point during the main workflow.
REFERENCE_TRANSLATED_FILE="/path/to/translation.json"


# (Optional.) `$REFERENCE_MASKED_FILE` stores the file system location of a
# 'reference masked series of question-answer pairs' of the LC-QuAD 2.0
# dataset in `$TARGET_LANGUAGE`.
#   If supplied, you can run the program
# `shell-scripts/validation/validate-masking.sh` to see how much your
# translated and masked set of question-answer pairs deviates from the
# reference. It is largely meant for debugging, and is not used at any point
# during the main workflow.
