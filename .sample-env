# `REFERENCE_TRANSLATED_FILE` should be a relative or absolute path to
# a JSON file. This file should store a translation of an original
# LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset split, such as one in Dutch (`${SPLIT}_nl.json`).
# This reference file can then be used to determine how much a
# just-generated translation deviates from the reference. You can
# perform such a 'deviation test' by executing the following command,
# only, of course, after you have made a filled-in copy of this
# `.sample-env`:
# 
# ```sh
# (set -a .env && source .env && ./shell-scripts/validate.sh)
# ```
#
# Testing for  deviation may be useful, as Google Cloud Translate seems
# to change their neural machine translation (NMT) models from time to
# time, affecting reproducibility.
